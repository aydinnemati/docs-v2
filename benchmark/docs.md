# Disk latency
- Disk latency refers to the time delay between a request for data and the return of the data. It sounds like a simple thing, but this time can be critical to the performance of a system.

# Measurement 	Description
## Total-IOPS:
- Total number of I/O operations per second (when performing a mix of read and write tests)
## Random-Read-IOPS:
- Average number of random read I/O operations per second
## Random-Write-IOPS:
- Average number of random write I/O operations per second
## Sequential-Read-IOPS:
- Average number of sequential read I/O operations per second
## Sequential-Write-IOPS:
- Average number of sequential write I/O operations per second
